         <h3 id="sun">Our Sun is actually a star</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Can you name the closest star to Earth? It may seem like a trick
               question, but it’s actually the Sun.</li>
            <li>While our Sun is extremely
               important to life on Earth, and may seem extraordinary to us, it
               is
               actually a very ordinary star in terms of the universe.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Stars are
            giant objects, mainly made of <span>hydrogen and helium</span>,
            that
            produce
            light and heat from internal nuclear forces. <br>More simply, a
            star
            is
            a giant ball of gas held together by its own gravity with nuclear
            reactions at its core. Our sun is classified as a main sequence
            G-type star. Stars are the building <mark>blocks of
               galaxies</mark>.
            While we can
            never count all the stars in the universe, astronomers estimate
            that
            there are approximately <mark>300 billion stars</mark> in our
            Milky
            Way galaxy
            alone. There are billions of galaxies (with many different types)
            in
            our universe, each with millions to billions of stars.

         <h3 id="halley">We won’t see Halley’s Comet again until 2061</h3>
         <p>
            Comets can be thought of as space snowballs. They formed millions of
            years ago during the formation of our solar system. Like planets,
            comets orbit the Sun, however, their orbits are very large, often
            reaching past the orbits of many planets. This is why we only see
            comets every now and again. Halley’s comet was last seen in 1986 and
            won’t be seen again <mark>until 2061</mark>. Although I was
            technically alive in
            1986 to see Halley’s comet, I was only 2-years old, and I think my
            parents forgot to let me know about it. The best comet I have ever
            seen in my lifetime was comet Neowise, in the summer of 2020.

         <h3 id="lunar">The lunar surface will be home to the first footprints
            for millions of years</h3>
         <p>
            On Earth, tracks from humans and animals do not last long. We have
            an atmosphere that gives us winds and weather. The Moon has no
            atmosphere. This means that there is no weather or water to erode
            the footprints the astronauts left on the Moon. Unless there is an
            impact on the Moon nearby the Apollo landing site that blows up dust
            from the surface of the Moon, the footprints and the spacecraft
            prints will be there for millions of years.

         <h3 id="andromeda">Milky Way will collide with the Andromeda
            galaxy</h3>
         <p>
            While galaxies seem far apart, many are relatively close to each
            other and will collide. In 4 billion years, our Milky Way galaxy
            will collide with our neighboring Andromeda Galaxy. Computer
            simulations predict that it will take another 2 million years after
            the initial collision for our two galaxies to fully merge into one
            new galaxy.
